# Option Pricing Models: Theoretical and Computational Foundations

## Introduction to Options

### Definition

An option is a financial derivative contract providing the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call) or sell (put) an underlying asset at a predetermined price within a specified timeframe.

### Core Valuation Challenge

The fundamental problem in option pricing is quantifying the fair market value of potential future financial outcomes under uncertainty.

## Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model

### Historical Context

Developed by Fischer Black, Myron Scholes, and Robert Merton in 1973, this model revolutionized financial derivatives pricing by introducing a probabilistic approach to valuing options.

### Fundamental Assumptions

1. Efficient market hypothesis
2. Log-normal distribution of stock prices
3. Continuous trading
4. No transaction costs
5. Constant risk-free rate and volatility
6. No dividends during option's life

### Mathematical Framework

#### Key Parameters

- `S`: Current stock price
- `K`: Strike price
- `r`: Risk-free interest rate
- `σ`: Price volatility
- `T`: Time to expiration

#### Probability Calculation: d1 and d2

```
d1 = [ln(S/K) + (r + σ²/2) * T] / (σ * √T)
d2 = d1 - σ * √T
```

**Computational Interpretation**:

- `ln(S/K)`: Price-to-strike ratio logarithm
- `(r + σ²/2) * T`: Risk-adjusted expected return
- `σ * √T`: Volatility scaling factor

#### Pricing Formulas

**Call Option**:

```
C = S * N(d1) - K * e^(-r*T) * N(d2)
```

**Put Option**:

```
P = K * e^(-r*T) * N(-d2) - S * N(-d1)
```

Where `N(x)` represents the cumulative standard normal distribution function.

## Binomial Tree Option Pricing Model

### Conceptual Approach

Discretizes potential price movements into a probabilistic decision tree, allowing more flexible option valuation.

#### Key Calculations

1. **Price Movement Factors**:

```
u = e^(σ * √Δt)  # Upward price movement
d = 1/u          # Downward price movement
```

2. **Risk-Neutral Probability**:

```
p = (e^(r*Δt) - d) / (u - d)
```

### Computational Methodology

- Constructs a binomial tree of potential stock prices
- Performs backward induction to calculate option value
- Supports more complex option structures

## Option Greeks: Sensitivity Analysis

### Delta (Δ)

- Measures option price change relative to underlying asset price
- Range: 0 to 1 for calls, -1 to 0 for puts

### Gamma (Γ)

- Rate of delta's change
- Indicates option price convexity
- Highest near the strike price

### Vega (ν)

- Sensitivity to volatility changes
- Quantifies price fluctuation potential

### Theta (Θ)

- Measures time decay
- Represents value erosion as expiration approaches

## Computational Considerations

### Limitations

- Assumes idealized market conditions
- Sensitive to input parameter estimations
- Does not account for:
  - Market frictions
  - Liquidity constraints
  - Extreme market events

## Advanced Research Directions

1. Machine learning integration
2. Stochastic volatility modeling
3. High-frequency trading adaptations
4. Improved volatility estimation techniques

## Theoretical Conclusion

Option pricing models represent sophisticated mathematical frameworks for quantifying financial uncertainty. They transform complex probabilistic scenarios into computable, actionable financial insights.

**Fundamental Principle**: Mathematical models provide structured approximations of market dynamics, not absolute predictive mechanisms.

## Preface: Theoretical Framework of Financial Derivatives

### Epistemological Context

Option pricing represents a critical intersection of:

- Stochastic calculus
- Probabilistic decision theory
- Financial economics
- Computational mathematics

## Theoretical Underpinnings of Option Valuation

### Probabilistic State Space Modeling

#### Fundamental Stochastic Processes

1. **Wiener Process (Brownian Motion)**

   - Continuous-time random walk
   - Key characteristics:
     * Independent increments
     * Normally distributed variations
     * Continuous sample paths
2. **Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)**

   - Probabilistic model for stock price evolution
   - Differential stochastic equation:

     ```
     dS(t) = μS(t)dt + σS(t)dW(t)
     ```

     Where:* `S(t)`: Stock price at time t

     * `μ`: Drift coefficient
     * `σ`: Volatility coefficient
     * `W(t)`: Wiener process

### Martingale Pricing Theory

#### No-Arbitrage Principle

- Fundamental theorem of asset pricing
- Ensures consistent pricing across different market scenarios
- Eliminates risk-free profit opportunities

#### Risk-Neutral Valuation

- Transforms real-world probability distributions
- Allows option pricing through expected value discounting
- Mathematical representation:
  ```
  V = E[max(0, S_T - K)] * e^(-rT)
  ```

## Advanced Mathematical Formulations

### Stochastic Differential Equations (SDE)

- Generalized Black-Scholes pricing kernel
- Incorporates:
  * Continuous-time trading
  * Frictionless markets
  * Constant volatility assumption

### Information Theory Perspective

- Options as information-processing financial instruments
- Quantify uncertainty through entropy measures
- Relate option pricing to information compression

## Computational Complexity Analysis

### Algorithmic Considerations

1. **Numerical Methods**

   - Monte Carlo simulation
   - Finite difference methods
   - Binomial/trinomial tree algorithms
2. **Computational Complexity**

   - Black-Scholes: O(1) complexity
   - Binomial Tree: O(n²) complexity
   - Monte Carlo: O(√n) convergence rate

## Empirical Validation Methodologies

### Statistical Testing Frameworks

1. **Backtesting Protocols**

   - Historical market data analysis
   - Out-of-sample performance evaluation
2. **Model Calibration Techniques**

   - Maximum likelihood estimation
   - Bayesian inference methods
   - Moment matching algorithms

## Theoretical Extensions and Limitations

### Generalized Pricing Models

1. **Stochastic Volatility Models**

   - Heston Model
   - SABR Model
   - Local volatility models
2. **Jump-Diffusion Processes**

   - Merton Model
   - Kou Model
   - Accounting for discontinuous price movements

### Model Limitations

- Parameter sensitivity
- Assumption of continuous trading
- Normality distribution constraints
- Liquidity risk exclusion

#### Disclaimer - This is my first take on quant and option pricing not. The model is far from having any real application. I am no expert in the financial and future market and still learning while doing. Use this at your own risk.

## Advanced Option Pricing Model: Deep Dive

## Introduction

This document provides an in-depth explanation of the advanced features implemented in our Option Pricing Model.

## New Advanced Features

### 1. Implied Volatility Calculation

#### Overview

Implied volatility is a critical metric in options trading that represents the market's expectation of future stock price volatility.

#### Implementation Details

- **Method**: Newton-Raphton numerical method
- **Algorithm Steps**:
  1. Start with an initial volatility guess
  2. Calculate the difference between model price and market price
  3. Use derivative (vega) to adjust volatility estimate
  4. Iterate until convergence or max iterations reached

#### Code Example

```python
option = BlackScholesOption(
    spot_price=100, 
    strike_price=100, 
    risk_free_rate=0.05, 
    volatility=0.2, 
    time_to_expiry=1
)
implied_vol = option.implied_volatility(market_price=10)
```

### 2. Scenario Analysis

```python
scenario_results = option.scenario_analysis(
    spot_price_range=(50, 150, 20),
    volatility_range=(0.1, 1.0, 20)
)
```

## Mathematical Background
