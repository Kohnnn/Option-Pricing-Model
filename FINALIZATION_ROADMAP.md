# Final Implementation Roadmap: Option Pricing Model

This document outlines the final phases of development to complete the Option Pricing Model application, incorporating user feedback for a robust and user-friendly final product.

---

## Phase 1: API Integration and Data Automation

**Objective:** To fix the existing API integration for real-time data fetching and automate the calculation of key financial metrics, ensuring the application uses current and accurate data.

**Key Tasks:**
- **Fix Alpha Vantage API Integration:**
    - Debug and resolve issues in [`data_provider.py`](data_provider.py) to ensure reliable fetching of stock prices.
    - Implement robust error handling for API rate limits and data availability.
- **Automate Historical Volatility Calculation:**
    - Integrate the volatility calculation from [`volatility_engine.py`](volatility_engine.py) with the data provider.
    - Automatically calculate and display the historical volatility for the selected underlying asset.
- **Automate Risk-Free Rate Fetching:**
    - Add functionality to [`data_provider.py`](data_provider.py) to fetch the current risk-free rate (e.g., from Treasury yields).
    - Populate the UI with the fetched risk-free rate automatically.

**Expected Deliverables:**
- A fully functional data provider that reliably fetches and processes required market data.
- UI inputs for historical volatility and risk-free rate are automatically populated with current data.
- A seamless data pipeline from the API to the pricing models.

## Phase 2: Model Comparison Feature

**Objective:** To implement a model comparison feature that allows users to run multiple pricing models simultaneously and compare their results.

**Key Tasks:**
- **Create "Model Comparison" Tab:**
    - Add a new tab to the Streamlit UI in [`streamlit_app.py`](streamlit_app.py) dedicated to model comparison.
- **Implement Multi-Model Selection:**
    - Add UI elements (e.g., checkboxes or a multi-select box) to allow users to choose which models to run.
- **Display Comparative Results:**
    - Present the results from the selected models in a clear, side-by-side comparison table.
    - Include key metrics such as option price and Greeks for each model.
- **Visualize Comparison:**
    - Create a chart that plots the option prices from different models against a variable parameter (e.g., strike price or time to maturity).

**Expected Deliverables:**
- A new "Model Comparison" tab in the application.
- A user-friendly interface for selecting and comparing multiple option pricing models.
- A comparison table and chart that clearly illustrate the differences in model outputs.

## Phase 3: UX/UI Polish and Explanations

**Objective:** To enhance the user experience by improving the application's layout and integrating detailed explanations of the financial models and risk metrics.

**Key Tasks:**
- **Integrate Model Explanations:**
    - For each pricing model, add a concise explanation of its methodology, assumptions, and best-use cases directly within the UI.
- **Explain Risk Calculations:**
    - Provide clear definitions and interpretations for each of the "Greeks" (Delta, Gamma, Vega, Theta, Rho).
- **Improve Layout and Design:**
    - Refine the overall layout of the Streamlit application for better readability and a more professional appearance.
    - Use containers, columns, and expanders to organize content effectively.

**Expected Deliverables:**
- An intuitive and polished user interface.
- In-app documentation that makes complex financial concepts accessible to users.
- A more engaging and educational user experience.

## Phase 4: Final Testing and Validation

**Objective:** To ensure the final application is stable, reliable, and accurate through comprehensive testing and validation.

**Key Tasks:**
- **Conduct Full Regression Testing:**
    - Execute all existing unit and integration tests to ensure that recent changes have not introduced any regressions.
    - Test all features, including data fetching, model calculations, and UI interactions.
- **Validate New Features:**
    - Specifically test the Model Comparison feature and the automated data population.
    - Cross-verify model results with external financial calculators or known benchmarks.
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):**
    - Perform a final review of the application from a user's perspective to catch any usability issues.

**Expected Deliverables:**
- A fully tested and validated application, free of critical bugs.
- A high degree of confidence in the accuracy and reliability of the pricing models and data.
- A final, production-ready version of the Option Pricing Model application.
