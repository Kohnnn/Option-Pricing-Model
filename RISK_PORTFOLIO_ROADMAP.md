# Implementation Roadmap: Risk Management, Portfolio Valuation, and Stochastic Calculus

This document outlines the implementation plan for adding advanced risk management, portfolio valuation, and stochastic calculus features to the Option Pricing Model application.

## Phase 1: Core Portfolio and Risk Infrastructure

*   **Objective:** To establish the foundational modules for portfolio management and basic risk calculations. This phase will create the core data structures and classes that will be used throughout the subsequent phases.
*   **Key Tasks:**
    *   Create a new file: `portfolio.py`.
        *   Define a `Portfolio` class to hold a collection of assets (stocks, options, etc.).
        *   Implement methods to add, remove, and update assets in the portfolio.
        *   Implement basic portfolio valuation logic (e.g., summing the value of all assets).
    *   Create a new file: `risk_management.py`.
        *   Define a base `RiskModel` class.
        *   Implement initial placeholder functions for portfolio Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Vega, Theta).
*   **Expected Deliverables:**
    *   `portfolio.py` module with a functional `Portfolio` class.
    *   `risk_management.py` module with the base `RiskModel` class and function stubs for Greeks.
    *   Unit tests for the `Portfolio` class.

## Phase 2: Stochastic Process Implementation

*   **Objective:** To implement the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic process, which will be used for modeling mean-reverting assets and for Monte Carlo simulations.
*   **Key Tasks:**
    *   Create a new file: `stochastic_processes.py`.
    *   Implement the `OrnsteinUhlenbeckProcess` class.
        *   The class should allow for simulation of price paths.
        *   Parameters: mean-reversion speed, long-term mean, volatility.
    *   Integrate the process with the existing data provider for fetching initial asset prices.
*   **Expected Deliverables:**
    *   `stochastic_processes.py` module with a validated `OrnsteinUhlenbeckProcess` class.
    *   Unit tests for the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck simulation.
    *   Example usage script demonstrating path generation.

## Phase 3: Advanced Risk Model Implementation

*   **Objective:** To build out the advanced risk models, providing a comprehensive suite of tools for risk analysis.
*   **Key Tasks:**
    *   **Value at Risk (VaR):**
        *   Implement Historical VaR using historical market data.
        *   Implement Monte Carlo VaR using the `OrnsteinUhlenbeckProcess`.
        *   Implement Parametric VaR (Variance-Covariance method).
    *   **Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR):**
        *   Implement CVaR calculation, building upon the VaR models.
    *   **Stress Testing:**
        *   Develop a framework for applying custom scenarios to the portfolio (e.g., market crashes, interest rate shocks).
        *   Implement functions to re-value the portfolio under these stress scenarios.
*   **Expected Deliverables:**
    *   Completed VaR and CVaR functions in `risk_management.py`.
    *   A flexible stress testing framework in `risk_management.py`.
    *   Unit tests for all new risk models.

## Phase 4: UI Integration and Feature Enhancement

*   **Objective:** To expose the new portfolio and risk management features to the end-user through the Streamlit web application.
*   **Key Tasks:**
    *   Create a new "Portfolio Analysis" section in the `streamlit_app.py`.
    *   Add UI components for:
        *   Creating and managing a portfolio.
        *   Running VaR and CVaR calculations and displaying the results.
        *   Configuring and running stress tests.
        *   Visualizing portfolio composition and risk metrics (e.g., using charts and tables).
*   **Expected Deliverables:**
    *   A new "Portfolio Analysis" tab in the Streamlit application.
    *   Interactive UI for all new features.
    *   Updated `streamlit_app.py` with the new section.

## Phase 5: Testing and Validation

*   **Objective:** To ensure the correctness, reliability, and performance of all newly implemented features through rigorous testing.
*   **Key Tasks:**
    *   **Integration Testing:**
        *   Test the end-to-end workflow from portfolio creation to risk analysis in the UI.
        *   Verify that all modules (`portfolio.py`, `risk_management.py`, `stochastic_processes.py`) work together seamlessly.
    *   **Model Validation:**
        *   Compare model outputs (VaR, CVaR) against known benchmarks or alternative implementations.
        *   Perform sensitivity analysis on model parameters.
    *   **Performance Testing:**
        *   Profile the performance of Monte Carlo simulations and stress tests.
        *   Optimize code for speed where necessary.
*   **Expected Deliverables:**
    *   A comprehensive suite of integration tests.
    *   A validation report documenting the accuracy of the risk models.
    *   Performance benchmarks for key calculations.

## Phase 6: Backtesting Framework

*   **Objective:** To build a backtesting engine to evaluate the performance of trading strategies based on the risk models and portfolio structure.
*   **Key Tasks:**
    *   Create a new file: `backtesting.py`.
    *   Define a `Backtester` class that can take a portfolio and a strategy as input.
    *   Implement logic to simulate trading strategies over historical data.
    *   Calculate and report key performance metrics (e.g., Sharpe Ratio, Sortino Ratio, Maximum Drawdown, Cumulative Returns).
*   **Expected Deliverables:**
    *   `backtesting.py` module with a reusable `Backtester` class.
    *   Unit tests for the backtesting engine.
    *   Example scripts demonstrating how to run a backtest.

## Phase 7: Documentation and Finalization

*   **Objective:** To update all project documentation to reflect the new features and ensure the project is easy to understand, use, and maintain.
*   **Key Tasks:**
    *   Update the main `README.md` with information about the new features.
    *   Create detailed documentation for the new modules:
        *   `portfolio.py`
        *   `risk_management.py`
        *   `stochastic_processes.py`
        *   `backtesting.py`
    *   Add comments and docstrings to all new classes and functions.
    *   Ensure `requirements.txt` is up-to-date with any new dependencies.
*   **Expected Deliverables:**
    *   Updated `README.md`.
    *   Complete API documentation for the new modules.
    *   Well-commented and documented code.
    *   Finalized `requirements.txt`.
